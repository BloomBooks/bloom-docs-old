Speaking of Enterprise, have you seen Star Trek "Strange New Worlds"?

If you have not selected your Bloom Enterprise subscription in the Collection Settings, you will see a notice if you try to use the **Image Description Tool**, **Impairment Visualizer**, **Sign Language Tool**, or **Bloom Reader Quiz Page**. Once you select or enter your subscription information in the Collection Settings, these tools will be activated. In this training course you will learn how to use each of these tools.



## How do I select my Bloom Enterprise subscription?

To activate your Bloom Enterprise subscription, go to **Settings** and click on the **Bloom Enterprise** tab. Select the Enterprise Subscription button and type or paste in your
Subscription Code. Bloom will need to restart after you make this change. After Bloom restarts, the features that were “locked” will be available to you to use.
