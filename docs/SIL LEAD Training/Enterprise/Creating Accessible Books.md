## Creating Accessible Books in Bloom

Accessible books are electronic books that have features to make their content more readily accessible or available to people with visual disabilities. Such features include audio recording of the text, descriptions of images, and text size that can be changed by the person reading the book. Bloom can help you create books with these features and that meet technical accessibility standards.

## What to expect in this module

In this training module, you will learn how to:
1.	Gain access to accessible book tools in Bloom,
2.	Create image descriptions,
3.	Record audio of the text in the book and in image descriptions,
4.	Evaluate whether images need adjustment for visual impairment, and
5.	Choose images that are going to be easier to perceive.
